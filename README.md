Project: Simplified Street Fighter Game (In Progress)
I am currently working on creating a simplified version of the Street Fighter game using C# and Windows Forms. The goal of the project is to simulate the core mechanics of a fighting game, focusing on user input, character movement, and basic combat actions such as attacking and blocking.

In this project, I have focused on learning how to work with visual elements in Windows Forms, such as buttons, labels, and custom graphics, to create an interactive game interface. The game includes basic character sprites, a simple fighting arena, and controls that allow players to move their character and perform actions using keyboard input.

Key aspects of the project include:

    Character movement and animations: Users can control their character's movement within the game, including walking, jumping, and performing basic attacks.

    Game loop and event handling: The game’s logic is driven by an ongoing loop, which handles user input, updates the game state, and renders animations.

    Visual design: I’ve utilized Windows Forms elements and custom drawing techniques to create a simple but engaging user interface for the game.

While still a work in progress, this project has been a valuable learning experience, helping me to improve my skills in C# programming, event handling, and working with visual components. I plan to expand the game by adding more complex features such as multi-stage battles, score tracking, and improved character animations.
